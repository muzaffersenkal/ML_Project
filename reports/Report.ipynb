    "Any technologies that can give more efficient, or faster analysis are very valuable. In recent decades, scientist and software developers are working together to improve healthcare technologies. Artificial Intelligence is playing huge role in these studies. Many studies have already surpassed human achievement, and many doctors use these systems as a decision mechanism, or diagnose the disease. Especially in cancer diagnosis or early diagnosis, artificial intelligence models provide great benefits to doctors in terms of speed and accuracy. Therefore, in this study, a model will be developed that can benefit the health field by using machine learning methods for skin cancer, which has been quite common in recent years."

    "Early diagnosis plays a critical role in disease treatment processes in the healthcare. One of these diseases is skin cancer. In case of early detection, it contributes greatly to the recovery process of the individual. \n",

Getting lab results is time consuming and also it is  painful to take samples from the patient. However, today's research shows that if a good quality image of the diseased area is taken, it is possible to detect it using machine learning and image processing methods."
