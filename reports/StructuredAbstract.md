## Context

Early diagnosis in healthcare plays a critical role in disease treatment as it,contributes greatly to the recovery process of the individual. 
Technologies that can shorten diagnostic time and increase accuracy are becoming increasingly important.

## Objective

The aim of this project is to develop a machine learning model that classifies skin lesions that can aid doctors in diagnosis.

## Method

The project was developed in the framework of CRISP-DM methodology using CNN algorithms that have proven their success in computer vision such as object detection, face recognition.

## Results

In the HAM10000 dataset ("Human Against Machine with 10000 training images"), the developed model achieved an accuracy of 87% in the validation set and 85% in the test set.

## Novelty

In this study, the CRISP-DM methodology, known as the data mining methodology, was used, and it set an example of how the CRISP-DM methodology provides flexibility, manageability and repeatability in deep learning projects as well.
