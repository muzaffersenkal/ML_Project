## About The Project

Any technologies that can give more efficient, or faster analysis are very valuable. In recent decades, scientist and software developers are working together to improve healthcare technologies. Artificial Intelligence is playing huge role in these studies. Many studies have already surpassed human achievement, and many doctors use these systems as a decision mechanism, or diagnose the disease. Especially in cancer diagnosis or early diagnosis, artificial intelligence models provide great benefits to doctors in terms of speed and accuracy. Therefore, project objective is to develop machine learning models that can classify correctly skin lessions. This project will be carried out using machine learning methods and will be evaluated using common model evaluation techniques.



## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally. To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.


### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.

-   Python

-   Jupyter Notebook [Link](https://jupyter.org)

    ```





## Usage

After you enter the second line of code, you'll see a series of automated messages as ProjectTemplate goes about doing its work. This work involves:

 
-   Reports files are in the `reports` directory.
-   Analysis are in the `src` directory.
-   Datasets path  `data`
-   Figures and graphs are in `graphs` directory.
